# Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for waveforms

Computational experiment on building a de-noising autoencoder
using [PyTorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) for typical detector waveforms.

This project originates from an undergraduate Final-Year project at the
University of Warwick and may be of use for digitial signal processing in physics.

The inspiration for the project and autoencoder structure comes from these articles: 
[paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.04189); 
[paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-11000-w).
