# Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) for waveforms

Computatinal experiment on building a de-noising autoencoder
using [PyTorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) for typical detector waveforms.

This project originates from an undergraduate Final-Year project at the
University of Warwick and may be of use for digitial signal processing in physics.

The inspiration for the autoencoder structure comes from this 
[paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1803.04189).
